        <h3>Navigating the Digital Pandemic: The Rise and Transformation of Cybercrime in Canada During COVID-19</h3>
        
        <h4>Project Summary</h4>
        <p>This project examines the evolution of cybercrime in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. It analyzes trends and patterns in cybercriminal activities using a data-driven approach. The study focuses on how the pandemic and the subsequent increase in digital dependency influenced the nature and frequency of cybercrimes.</p>
        
        <h4>Statistics Performed</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Used datasets from Statistics Canada on police-reported cybercrime and organized crime.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Deviation Analysis:</strong> Compared the spread of cybercrime and in-person crime values across different years.</li>
            <li><strong>Percentage Difference:</strong> Analyzed the percentage difference in crime rates pre-pandemic, during the pandemic, and post-pandemic.</li>
            <li><strong>Top-K Analysis:</strong> Identified the most frequent crime types during the pandemic years.</li>
            <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> Examined trends in cybercrime and in-person crime over time.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Key Findings</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Cybercrime significantly increased during the pandemic, while in-person crime showed a decrease.</li>
            <li>Fraud and extortion were the most prevalent types of cybercrime.</li>
            <li>Medium-sized cities experienced proportionately higher rates of cybercrime compared to larger cities.</li>
            <li>Quebec had some of the lowest rates of cybercrime, likely due to its strong focus on cybersecurity.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Images and Charts</h4>
        <p>Below are some key visualizations from the study:</p>
